~~~~~~~~~~~

Imports an async or sync HTTP client based on the user
defined interface in the schema.

For example this generator defined in the schema will generate
an async HTTP client.
```prisma
generator client {
  provider                    = "prisma-client-py"
  interface                   = "asyncio"
  recursive_type_depth        = -1
}
```
