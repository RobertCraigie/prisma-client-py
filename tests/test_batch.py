    This is to ensure that if an client method is updated then it's corresponding

    result of an anti-pattern but I could not figure out any good method for
    implementing batching and client methods together while maintaining static
    type safety and without making the templates horrible to maintain. If you
    have found a method that you think is good please make an issue/PR.
